"""
In this file I will write classes regarding to the recipies I want to
store for the user in question.
I will have at least two classes. One which contains the ingredients
for a specific recipe (maybe a recipe class) and one that stores the
recipe in a databank like structure.
The recipe class might need some more methods to display how much energy
or calories the recipe contains for a given amount of the food consumed
made with the recipe
